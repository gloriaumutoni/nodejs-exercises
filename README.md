function runService(workerData) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const worker = new Worker('./worker.js', { workerData });
        
        worker.on('message', resolve);
        worker.on('error', reject);
        worker.on('exit', (code) => {
            if (code !== 0)
                reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`));
        });
    });
}

runService(1000000)
    .then(result => console.log(result))
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

**Worker File (`worker.js`)**:
```javascript
const { parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < workerData; i++) {
    sum += i;
}

parentPort.postMessage(sum);
```

## Miscellaneous

## Monitoring Application Performance

****87. What tools can be used for monitoring performance in Node.js applications?****

Tools like New Relic, AppDynamics, PM2, and Clinic.js help monitor performance metrics such as response times, resource usage, and error rates.

## Handling Concurrency Issues

****88. How do you handle concurrency issues when accessing shared resources in Node.js?****

You can use locking mechanisms or atomic operations provided by databases or libraries like Redis to manage concurrent access safely.

## Implementing OAuth2 Authentication

****89. How do you implement OAuth2 authentication in a Node.js application?****

You can use libraries like Passport.js along with strategies like OAuth2 to handle authentication flows securely.

### Example with Passport OAuth2 Strategy:
```javascript
const passport = require('passport');
const OAuth2Strategy = require('passport-oauth2');

passport.use(new OAuth2Strategy({
    authorizationURL: 'https://provider.com/oauth/authorize',
    tokenURL: 'https://provider.com/oauth/token',
}, function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {
    // Handle user profile here
}));
```

## Using CORS Middleware

****90. Why is CORS necessary for web applications?****

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is necessary because it allows web applications running at one origin to make requests to resources at another origin securely while preventing unauthorized access.

### Implementing CORS Middleware:
```javascript
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
```

## Working with External APIs

****91. How do you consume external APIs in your Node.js applications?****

You can use libraries like Axios or the built-in `http`/`https` modules to make HTTP requests to external APIs.

### Example with Axios:
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => console.log(response.data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

## Session Management Strategies

****92. What are some common strategies for managing sessions in web applications?****
Common strategies include:

- Server-side sessions stored in memory or databases.
- Client-side sessions stored as cookies.
- Token-based sessions using JWTs for stateless authentication.

Hereâ€™s an in-depth exploration of the core concepts of Node.js, covering essential topics that every developer should understand to effectively work with this powerful JavaScript runtime.

## 1. Asynchronous Programming

Node.js is built on an asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model. This means that operations like reading files, querying databases, or making HTTP requests do not block the execution of other code. Instead, Node.js uses callbacks, Promises, and async/await to handle asynchronous operations.

### Example:
Using callbacks:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});
```

Using Promises:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8')
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

Using async/await:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFile() {
    try {
        const data = await fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8');
        console.log(data);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
}

readFile();
```

## 2. Event Loop

The event loop is a fundamental concept in Node.js that allows it to perform non-blocking operations. It continuously checks the call stack and the message queue to execute tasks. When an asynchronous operation completes, its callback is added to the message queue, which the event loop processes when the call stack is empty.

### Phases of the Event Loop:
1. **Timers**: Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.
2. **I/O Callbacks**: Executes callbacks for I/O operations.
3. **Idle/Prepare**: Internal phase for system tasks.
4. **Poll**: Retrieves new I/O events; executes their callbacks.
5. **Check**: Executes callbacks scheduled by `setImmediate()`.
6. **Close Callbacks**: Handles close events (e.g., `socket.on('close')`).

## 3. Modules and Modularization

Node.js uses a module system based on CommonJS, allowing developers to break their code into reusable modules. Each file in Node.js is treated as a separate module.

### Creating a Module:
**math.js**
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

module.exports = { add };
```

**app.js**
```javascript
const math = require('./math');

console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
```

## 4. Error Handling

Effective error handling is crucial in Node.js applications due to its asynchronous nature. Common practices include using try/catch blocks with async/await and handling errors in callbacks.

### Example:
Using try/catch with async/await:
```javascript
async function readFile() {
    try {
        const data = await fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8');
        console.log(data);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error reading file:', err);
    }
}
```

## 5. Streams and Buffers

Streams are objects that allow you to read or write data in chunks rather than all at once. This is particularly useful for handling large files or data streams efficiently.

### Types of Streams:
- **Readable Streams**: Used for reading data (e.g., `fs.createReadStream()`).
- **Writable Streams**: Used for writing data (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream()`).
- **Duplex Streams**: Can read and write data (e.g., TCP sockets).
- **Transform Streams**: Can modify data as it is written or read.

### Example of a Readable Stream:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('largefile.txt');
readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);
});
```

## 6. Event Emitters

Event emitters are objects that can emit events and listen for them using listeners or handlers. They are a core part of Node.js's asynchronous programming model.

### Example:
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

myEmitter.on('event', () => {
    console.log('An event occurred!');
});

myEmitter.emit('event'); // Triggers the event
```

## 7. The Global Object

Node.js provides a global object that contains various properties and methods available throughout your application without needing to import them explicitly.

### Common Global Objects:
- `global`: The global namespace.
- `process`: Provides information about the current process.
- `console`: For logging output.
- `__dirname`: The directory name of the current module.
- `__filename`: The filename of the current module.

## 8. File System Operations

Node.js provides a built-in `fs` module that allows you to interact with the file system asynchronously or synchronously.

### Example of Reading a File Asynchronously:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});
```

## 9. Networking

Node.js has built-in modules like `http`, `https`, and `net` that allow you to create web servers, make HTTP requests, and handle network protocols easily.

### Creating an HTTP Server:
```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

## 10. Process Management

The `process` object provides information about the current Node.js process and allows you to control it, such as handling signals and accessing command-line arguments.

### Example:
```javascript
console.log(`Process ID: ${process.pid}`);
console.log(`Node version: ${process.version}`);
console.log(`Command-line arguments: ${process.argv}`);
```
